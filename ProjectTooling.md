# Visual Studio Code is

Visual Studio Code blends the ease of use of a source code editor with advanced developer features such as IntelliSense code completion and debugging.
It is, first and foremost, an editor who stays out of your way. Less time fussing with your environment and more time implementing your ideas thanks to the delightfully frictionless edit-build-debug cycle.

## Why it’s useful:

Visual Studio Code's core feature is a lightning-fast source code editor that's ideal for day-to-day use. Syntax highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation, box-selection, snippets, and more are all available in VS Code, which supports hundreds of languages. You can traverse your code with ease thanks to intuitive keyboard shortcuts, easy modification, and community-contributed keyboard shortcut mappings. When it comes to serious coding, you'll typically benefit from tools that understand more code than just blocks of text. IntelliSense code completion, sophisticated semantic code understanding and navigation, and code refactoring are all included in Visual Studio Code.

# PyCharm is

PyCharm has been the most widely used IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for python, one of the most widely used general-purpose programming languages today.

Python is a very versatile language, and many programmers nowadays use it to create software applications, so the code must be concise, clear, and readable. They can even speed up the development of bespoke software applications by using one of the numerous IDEs that support Python. Aside from that, software app testing companies frequently use the Python programming language.

# VS Code versus PyCharm

- Performance:

When compared to PyCharm, Microsoft's Visual Studio Code is much faster. When compared to PyCharm, it is extremely light. Visual Studio Code is the clear winner when it comes to a modular approach to wiring code. Microsoft's integrated development environment (IDE) has a large number of extensions, add-ons, and other libraries. PyCharm is said to have a very long lead time.

- Extensibility:

PyCharm is part of the JetBrains IDE family, and all of the JetBrains IDEs allow for plugin extensibility. On the JetBrains website, PyCharm currently has nearly 3000 extensions.
VS Code, on the other hand, is designed to be a basic editor that can be expanded into a full IDE with the help of extensions. A single extension provides full Python support (including syntax highlighting, debugging, and code completion). VS Code includes extensions for practically everything, and developers may easily create their own. The VS Code Marketplace has all of these extensions. As a result, VS Code is far more extensible than PyCharm.

# What is Linux and why it is used?

The most well-known and widely used open source operating system is Linux. Linux is an operating system that sits on top of all other software on a computer, receiving requests from other applications and relaying those requests to the computer's hardware.

# What is Windows?

In a system that allows multiple viewing areas as part of a graphical user interface, a window is a discrete viewing area on a computer display screen ( GUI ). As part of a windowing system, windows are handled by a windows manager. The user can usually resize a window.

## Linux vs Windows:

- users
  Regular, Administrative(root), and Service users are the three types of users in Linux, whereas there are four types of user accounts in Windows (Administrator, Standard, Child and Guest).

- Usage
  According to market research, Windows is loaded on 92.63 % of the world's PCs, whereas Linux is used by only 1% of PC users. Many users claim that Linux is more difficult to operate than Windows, hence its appeal for home use is limited. It is primarily intended for serious applications, such as application servers. As a result, irrespective of the GUI, corporate servers run on Linux.
  Also, due to the licensing agreement with Microsoft, various PC vendors are entitled to bundle Windows OS with their PC, enabling Windows to gain market popularity over Linux.
- Kernel
  Linux employs a monolithic kernel, which takes up more disk space, whereas Windows uses a micro-kernel, which takes up less disk space but reduces the system's efficiency.
- File Systems
  Files are kept in directories/folders on different hard drives in Microsoft Windows, such as C: D: E: whereas in Linux, files are organized in a tree structure, starting with the root directory and branching out to various sub-directories. Everything in Linux is treated as a file. Files are files, and externally connected devices (such as a printer, mouse, and keyboard) are also files.

# What is GitHub:

GitHub is a repository hosting platform that combines all of a developer's issue tracking and code management needs into one easy-to-use free package. GitHub is so well-known that it's almost synonymous with Git.

GitHub hosts the vast majority of open-source code repositories. This is surprising given that it was the sole platform of its kind at the time of its creation. There aren't many free alternatives that offer the same powerful core features.

# What is GitLab:

Gitlab is a service that allows you to access Git repositories from anywhere. The services offer extra capabilities to help manage the software development lifecycle in addition to hosting your code. These extra features include coordinating code sharing amongst multiple individuals, bug tracking, wiki space, and other ‘social coding' tools.

## GitHub vs GitLab

Both gitLab and GitHub are web-based repositories that aid in code management and file sharing with a remote repository. as a result of the files on the web change often, all of the information is hold on in a repository and should be accessed at any time. each GitHub and GitLab are needed for Git development to trace changes in a source code.

### Why I want to use Visual Studio Code:

VS Code comes with enhanced built-in support for Node.js programming, including JavaScript and TypeScript, and is driven by the same underlying technologies as Visual Studio. Web technologies such as JSX/React, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Less, and JSON are all well-represented in VS Code.

### Why I want to use Linux:

Windows is less dependable than Linux. How many times as a Windows user have you had a program hang, and when you try to close it from the Task Manager (if you can get it to open in the first place), it remains open, requiring multiple efforts to close it

Linux applications are less likely to lock up. Anyone can look at, evaluate, and improve the underlying code because Linux and many of its applications are open-source. This results in a stable system with rapid bug and security fixes.

### Why I want to use github:

GitHub is a lot older than GitLab, which means there are a lot of users that have been using it for a long time and are quite knowledgeable about it. It also means that most people are familiar with the platform. GitLab isn't difficult to use, but when it comes to community, size does matter. pointed to countless GitHub repositories from all sorts of projects, whether it be for issue reporting, readme or installations.
