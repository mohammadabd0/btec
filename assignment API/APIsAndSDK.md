# infroduction

APIs (application programming interfaces) come in several forms. API designers will choose from a range of protocols and standards once making a new API, depending on the type of API they're creating, and its purpose. this article takes a look at a number of necessary API types and protocols, including REST API protocols.

# Web Apis is

Apis that may be accessed over the http protocol are referred to as web Apis. The API defines endpoints as well as acceptable request and response formats. The Apis used to connect with the browser are known as web Apis. They could also be similar to web notifications and web storage services. Different types of web Apis, such as open, internal, and partner Apis, have differing levels of security and privacy. A composite API is a collection of information or service APIs made up of many web APIs.

## types

## public APIs:

Open APIs, also known as external or public APIs, are available to developers and other users with minimal restrictions. they will need registration, and use of an API key, or even completely open. they're supposed for external users to access data or services. As an example, take a look at the provided by the united kingdom government. Any developer will access it, without even registering, allowing app builders to incorporate governmental data on restaurant standards in their apps.

## Internal APIs

Internal APIs, as contrast to open APIs, are designed to be hidden from outside users. They are used to share resources within a firm. They allow different teams or departments inside a company to use each other's tools, data, and programs. Security and access control, an audit record of system access, and a common interface for connecting multiple services are all advantages of using internal APIs over conventional integration techniques.

## Composite APIs

Composite APIs are a type of API that combines multiple data or service APIs. They're made with an API creation tool's API orchestration features. They allow developers to create a single call to several endpoints. Composite APIs are useful in a microservices architecture pattern, for example, where you need data from multiple services to complete a single job.

## Partner APIs

Partner APIs. A partner API, only available to specifically selected and authorized outside developers or API consumers, is a means that to facilitate business-to-business activities. For example, if a business needs to by selection share its customer data with outside CRM firms, a partner API will connect the internal customer information system with those external parties -- no different API use is permitted.

# Explain the benefits of APIs

- Automation:

APIs allow computers to manage tasks rather than people. Agencies can use APIs to update work flows to make them more efficient and productive.

- Application:

The delivery of services and information is more flexible since APIs can access app components.

- More scope:

An API can be used to create an application layer that can be used to distribute information and services to new audiences and can be customized to create unique user experiences.

- Adaptation:

APIs help in appear over time as needs vary over time. Data migration is better facilitated and information is reviewed more carefully when using this technology. APIs, in a sense, make service provision more flexible.

- Integration:

APIs make it much easier to embed content from any website or app. This ensures that information is delivered in a more lively manner and that the user experience is more integrated.

# Analyze the differences between API and SDK

- What is an SDK?

A Software Development Kit (SDK) is a collection of tools, libraries, documentation, code examples, methods, and guides designed to work with a specific platform. SDKs often provide a set of APIs for developers to use in order to construct and develop applications. The interfaces are used by the applications to implement functionality.

- What is an API?

When developing code that interacts with other software that may speak a different language, the two programs must be able to communicate with one another. APIs have a role in this. It stands for Application Program Interface, and it does exactly what it says on the tin. It is a program that allows two application programs to speak in the same language.
